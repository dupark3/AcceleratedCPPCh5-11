Exercise 5-11 

"In text processing it is sometimes useful to know whether a word 
has any ascenders or descneders. Ascenders are the parts of lowercase letters that extend above the text line (b, d, f, h, k, l).
Similarly, descenders descende below the line (g, j, p, q, y). 

Write a program to determine whether a word has any ascenders or descenders. 
Extend that program to find the longest word in the dictionary that has neither ascenders nor descenders."
